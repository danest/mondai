  <h1>Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>By using the site, you're agreeing to these terms</h3>

	<p>As a user ("You," "Your") of the services ("Services") and visual or verbal information ("Content") provided by Mondai.me ("Us," "Our," "We"), its users ("User Content" or "User Generated Content") or partners from whom we may license data or content ("Partner Content" or "Third Party Content"), including but not limited to the Mondai.me website at http:// www.mondai.me, the mondai.team@gmail.com email address, you are agreeing to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions ("Terms of Service" or "Terms").</p>

  <h3>You are responsible for any consequences of violating these terms</h3>

	<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Mondai.mee may suffer) of any such breach. If you have created an Account or contributed Content ("Your Content") to Mondai.me, you recognize that violation of these Terms may result in termination of your account and loss of access to Your Content contributed to Mondai.me.</p>

	<p>The failure of Mondai.me to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h3>We may modify these terms without explicit notice</h3>

	<p>These Terms of Service apply to all current features and to new features that are added to the existing Service.</p>

	<p>Mondai.me reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service without explicit notice. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You are responsible for reviewing our current Terms of Service at http://www.mondai.me/tos</p>

	<p>The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which can be found at http://www.mondai.me.com/tos, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Mondai.me and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Mondai.me (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>

  <h3>Consuming Content</h3>

	<p>Content may not be accurate, use at your own risk</p>

	<p>Because Mondai.me relies on User Generated Content, Third Party Content and links to Third Party Content, Mondai.me makes no claim of accuracy of any User Generated Content or Third Party Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk. User Content and Third Party Content do not represent the advice, views, opinions or beliefs of Mondai.me.</p>

	<p>All Content is the sole responsibility of the person who generated that content. We may not monitor or control the Content posted via the Services, and we cannot take responsibility for such Content.</p>

	<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, content or policies of such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by or affiliation with Mondai.me. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>

	<h3>You may encounter inappropriate content</h3>

	<p>By accessing the Service or following links to third-party websites you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, objectionable, or otherwise inappropriate. While Mondai.me does not endorse and reserves the right to remove such Content, you acknowledge and agree that Mondai.me cannot be responsible for such Content and that you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials.</p>

  <h3>Content may be protected by copyright laws</h3>

	<p>Content presented to you as part of the Service may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the person providing that content to Mondai.me (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Mondai.me or by the owners of that content, in a separate agreement.</p>

	<h3>Content may be stored or transmitted by third party vendors</h3>

	<p>Mondai.me uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.</p>
