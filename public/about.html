    <h1>About Mondai</h1>
	<h2>Mondai is the best way to discover your campus and get your questions answered by the people around you.</h2>
    <h3>Know your campus. Locally.</h3>
	<p>The goal of Mondai is to help you get the most of your college life and enjoy the best experience from the people that shared the 			 
	same experiences with you. We're here to help you connect you and your campus together. </p>
	
	<h3>There's more to college life than classes.</h3>
	<p>We believe that everyone knows some secret about their college, whether it is the easy class for a particular major or what is the  
	best place to hang out for History major. When we're going through college, we don't have the tool that would allow us to ask a questions
	and get the coolest answer. Mondai was born as an idea to connect you to your fellow college mates that share the same interest or had 
	an experience before.</p>
